This book is The hunger Games Author: Suzanne Collins
I choose this book, because this one of the first book series I 
enjoyed to read when I was in middle school, infact the book 
also had moves along with it so that also excited me to read
these books and my main reason for choosing this book is because
after I read this book I started to be more interested in reading.
