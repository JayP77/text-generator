Time complexity analysis:
For this program there are many different things that have time complexity the
major ones are the map of 2 string vectors which has the time complexity of the 
map with string vectors will be O(NlogN) to add to N vector. The time complexity of printMap
function will be (NLogN)*(M+X) where M is it takes to iterate 
through key vector and X is the time it takes to iterate 
throuugh value vector.
